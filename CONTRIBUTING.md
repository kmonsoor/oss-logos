# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Guidelines

* Add one link per Pull Request.
* Add the link: `* [software-name](http://example.com/logos-canonical-link/) - A short description ends with a period.`
    * Keep description concise, 1-liner.
* Add a section if needed.
    * Add the section description.
    * Add the section title to Table of Contents.
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, to avoid a duplicate.
* Avoid adding software or libraries that is just new, or pretty little known and used.
* Avoid links to directly a file (*.png, *.zip) as it might change pretty quickly. Rather add the page-link where it is officially presented.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.
* Send a Pull Request with a short description.
