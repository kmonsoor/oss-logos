:100: Official, organically-sourced logo(s) of awesome open-source project

A curated source-list of the official logos of many awesome open-source libraries, software and resources.

### What's different here from official souces ?
While official website is the canonical source of their own logo, here we're trying to maintain all of their links altogether. That's all.

Waste of time? Maybe. Boring? Of course not.
